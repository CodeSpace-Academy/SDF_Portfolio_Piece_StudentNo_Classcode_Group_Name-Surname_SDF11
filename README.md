# Portfolio Piece
# Introduction 
I was tasked with creating a responsive business landing page for a fictitious banking solution, Cache Bank, targeted at software developers. This project uses HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript to build a functional and professional webpage.

# Elements Included
A landing page that included a header and navigation bar, a hero and endorsements section, a features section, a statistics and getting started section, as well as a contact and footer section.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
HTML Layout: Was an area that I was able to complete efficiently as it consisted of the basic structure of the landing page.
Tailwind CSS Styling Elements: Were included in order to style the page and made building the responsive design. 

# Challenges Faced 
The styling elements for the Getting Started section were particularly difficult because of the length of the Tailwind. 

# Overall Learning Experience
This project allowed me to showcase my ability to create professional, functional landing pages, also while highlighting the importance, understanding, and use of the Tailwind cheatsheet.
